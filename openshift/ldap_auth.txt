To make this change, log on to all three Master nodes in the cluster as root, and on each one edit /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml. Search for the “url:” tag and change it from this (the last field might be sAMAccountName)

url: ldap://FRA-LDAP-OAAD.oa.pnrad.net/OU=Accounts,DC=oa,DC=pnrad,DC=net?cn

To this:

url: ldap://FRA-LDAP-OAAD.oa.pnrad.net/OU=Accounts,DC=oa,DC=pnrad,DC=net?sAMAccountName?sub?(memberOf=CN=xeops-ocp-act-user,OU=XEOPS,OU=Appl Groups,OU=Accounts,DC=oa,DC=pnrad,DC=net)

(all on one line). I have used sAMAccountName as the identifier rather than cn, since this is also used in the LDAP Group Sync code.

Then, while still logged on as root, on each node run:

# master-restart api
# master-restart controllers

Wait a couple of minutes, then test by logging on to the the console, once by a user in xeops-ocp-act-user (which should succeed, and once by a user not in that group (the login should fail).
